# python-for-scientific-computing

Work done to use Python (numpy, scipy, keras, etc.) for scientific computing, focused on using different algorithms to solve important PDEs in physics. Broken up into labs. Following the lab manual from https://www.physics.byu.edu/courses/computational/430. (The version at that URL may have changed, so see the chapter PDFs provided in each of the folders.)
